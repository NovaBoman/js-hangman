# Hangman game

This is the third assignment for first year Fullstack Web Developer students at Chas Academy.

## Assignment

Using JavaScript, create a working implementation of the classic "Hangman" game.

### Criteria

- A working version of the game that can be played on a webpage.
- The player must be able to play until the correct word has been guessed or they run out of guesses.
- Player must be able to guess at least 5 times before the game is over.
- A letter must be able to occur more than once in a word.

### Additional criteria

- The webpage should work for a variety of browsers and screens.

  - PC desktop (1920 x 1280).
  - Apple iPhone 8 (414 x 736).

- Design is optional but must contain:
  - A method for user to input guesses.
  - A visual representation of the "Hangman" process.

## Comments

For this assignment I didn't use the template code that was provided.
I chose to not use the original solution with using buttons for input and instead went with an input field to allow keyboard input from the player.
The Hangman images were created by me.

### Challenges

With limited experience the most challenging aspect of the assignment was knowing how and where to start. I ended up starting out with pen and paper, writing pseudo code and drawing a sketch of the different elements to include in the HTML and started working from there.
My focus at the beginning was getting the functionality to work in JS and then expanding on the HTML to create the visual representation.

I tried to make the webpage as responsive as possible while using a minimal amount of media queries. I have exlusively used relative units for font, width and height declarations to be be able to achieve this.

The main layout was created using grid and some elements use flex for positioning content within the grid area.
